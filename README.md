This repo contains the cvs format of a part of the ridership information Caltrain shared publicly


## Caltrain Ridership Information

Caltrain Shares the Ridership information publicly in their web page, the shared formats were not I can consume with my limited Python and Data Science experience. So, I decided to translate some of the data into cvs format. Caltrain is the owner of the data and it is subject to the licence thay enforce.

The CVS file only contains the 2019 Ridership data, excluded the riders with Bike data.
